# Charts-SwiftUI
This source code demonstrates a variety of different charts using the UIKit Charts Framework by Daniel Gindi (https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts)

You can download the source code and either use CocoaPods, or Carthage to add the Charts dependency or, as you can see in the two videos below, I simply add the framework through drag and drop.

The two videos below show you how I started by implementing a BarChart and a PieChart.  This source code follows the same basic procedure though I have changed things a little bit and have tried to include different options in each of the different chart examples so that you can figure out how you can implement in your own projects.
